# bf-anywhere
A brainf*ck interpreter that runs on the web, made with HTML/CSS/JS
This is not a compiler. It runs the program in realtime, which is pretty fast.
You could treat it like a REPL shell, but has no history. History support will be coming soon.

This implementation is pretty flexible, so you can modify the max a value goes to and the length of the tape.
